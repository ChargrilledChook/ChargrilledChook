## G'day! ğŸ‘‹

I'm a self taught developer based in the Greater Newcastle Region of NSW, Australia.

Coding combines my love of building things and solving puzzles. I picked up programming in 2019 while recovering from surgery; I quickly grew addicted and have been learning and creating new things ever since.
